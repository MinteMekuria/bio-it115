My name is Mintesnot Mekuria. I am an emerging professional at Year Up. 
I am young and very devoted to learn new things. I am enrolled in Software Development and Testing track. I have learned some coding skills at year up like HTML CSS. I have two years of experience working as a Front Desk officer. I believe hard work and consistency leads to success in life. My goal is to finish school become software developer and contribute my ability and skills to the profession in high demand. Thank you.
